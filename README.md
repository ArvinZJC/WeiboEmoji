# WeiboEmoji

Weibo, similar to Twitter, is a Chinese microblogging website launched by Sina. **Weibo Emoji** is a repository for saving and sharing most Emoji images used by the app Weibo.

## ATTENTION

1. Please note that these image files should never ever be used for commercial purposes. Just "help yourself" and have fun by, for instance, adding them into your favourites of chatting apps like WeChat and QQ.

2. The repository has been built based on Weibo App V10.8.1 (Android) and [Weibo HTML5](https://m.weibo.cn/) V2.4.9.

## Folder Instructions

### [Source 1](https://github.com/ArvinZJC/WeiboEmoji/tree/master/Source%201)

This folder contains Emoji images extracted from the specified resource folder in the corresponding APK file of the app. If you understand the principles of an APK file, you can easily find these fancy and vivid images as well.

Most images are WEBP ones, which are usually not supported when you want to use them in chatting apps. You can get PNG images by double clicking the BAT file included in this folder to run the script, but it is not recommended. Instead, it is one better choice for you to use file format converters like [Format Factory](http://www.pcgeshi.com/) (~~not AD~~).

### [Processed Images](https://github.com/ArvinZJC/WeiboEmoji/tree/master/Processed%20Images)

Don't want to convert WEBP images by yourself? Well then, just copy the processed image files from this folder.

### [Source 2](https://github.com/ArvinZJC/WeiboEmoji/tree/master/Source%202)

Once Weibo is installed, it will display not only local Emoji resources, but also a number of funny ones reflecting new trends in China Net. Trends often change. Hence, these amusing Emoji images may be frequently replaced by some new ones. These image files cannot be extracted from the APK file. Thanks to the developer tools of Google Chrome (I don't even know when Google changed the hot key of this feature to `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I`...), my solution is to dig for the source by browsing the HTML5 version of Weibo on a PC's browser. Obviously, these images are not so clear as those in the folder "Source 1".
